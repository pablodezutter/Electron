# Electron

##Having difficulties to install Electron (probs with the npm, had it before)

##Clean install in new mkdir

##First create package.json???

##Again a problem: (process:15209): Gtk-WARNING \*\*: 12:00:44.287: Locale not supported by C library.
Using the fallback 'C' locale.
Error launching app
Unable to find Electron app at /home/p/Documenten/Pablo_fun/Electron

Cannot find module '/home/p/Documenten/Pablo_fun/Electron'
Require stack:
/home/p/Documenten/Pablo_fun/Electron/node_modules/electron/dist/resources/default_app.asar/main.js

- Not able to get some of the data out of the object process, probably locked by Ubuntu...
  *Nice way to work but seems more complicated to start up
  *Also did a little bit of Materialize components -> little more visual than Bootstrap but it takes a while to know it.
